  This scenario tests an agent's ability to update React and related dependencies
  while maintaining compatibility and following best practices. The agent must
  handle version constraints, breaking changes, and ensure the project still
  builds and tests pass.

# =============================================================================
# EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS
# =============================================================================

# Simple dependency update scenario:
# - Remove targets section for open-ended updates
# - Use basic validation commands
# - Focus on install_success and tests_nonregression weights

# Complex migration scenario:
# - Add namespace_migrations for package renames
# - Use companion_versions for version alignment
# - Include typecheck validation
# - Higher weights for semantic_upgrade_quality

# Monorepo scenario:
# - Use workspaces: pnpm
# - Include monorepo_handling weight
# - Add workspace-specific validation commands
# - Consider breaking_changes_strategy weight

# Security-focused scenario:
# - High integrity_guard weight
# - Include deprecated_handling weight
# - Focus on semantic_upgrade_quality
# - Add security-specific validation commands
