title: "Pages Router to App Router Migration"
description: |
  This evaluation tests the ability to migrate a Next.js project from the legacy Pages Router (Next.js 12 and earlier) to the modern App Router (Next.js 13+). This is a fundamental architectural change that many real-world Next.js projects need to undergo.

    - "Migration Correctness (Weight: 30%): Accurate conversion from Pages Router to App Router structure, proper file organization (page.tsx, layout.tsx). Score 1-5: 1=incorrect structure, 5=perfect migration"
    - "Data Fetching Conversion (Weight: 25%): Proper transformation of getServerSideProps/getStaticProps to Server Components or server actions. Score 1-5: 1=broken data fetching, 5=optimal patterns"
    - "Routing & API Migration (Weight: 20%): Correct migration of dynamic routes, API routes to route handlers. Score 1-5: 1=routing broken, 5=seamless routing"
    - "Code Quality & Best Practices (Weight: 15%): Clean code, proper use of 'use client' directives, App Router conventions. Score 1-5: 1=poor quality, 5=exemplary"
    - "Overall Migration Success (Weight: 10%): Completeness, functionality preservation, no regressions. Score 1-5: 1=non-functional, 5=flawless migration"
