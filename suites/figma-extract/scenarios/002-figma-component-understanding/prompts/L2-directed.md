Build a component analysis system that classifies Figma components into specific types like Button, Input, Card, Modal, and others. Detect all variants including size, state, and style variations. Extract component properties such as text content, icons, colors, and interactive states. Structure the output as JSON with component metadata including id, name, type, variants, and properties.
