  "what component types should i classify figma components into": "Classify components into semantic UI types: buttons, inputs, cards, navigation, layout containers, typography elements, form controls, modals, and data display components. Use the component's structure, naming patterns, and child elements to infer its semantic type. For ambiguous cases, analyze the component's properties and variants to determine the most appropriate classification.",
  "how should i detect and document component variants": "Analyze Figma component properties to identify variants like size (small, medium, large), state (default, hover, active, disabled), style (primary, secondary, outline), and context-specific variations. Document each variant with its property names, possible values, and any visual or behavioral differences. Store variants in a structured format that maps property combinations to their visual outputs.",
  "what information should i extract about component properties": "Extract all component properties including their names, types (boolean, text, instance swap), default values, and constraints. Document any auto-layout properties, padding/spacing, constraints, and how properties affect the component's appearance. Include information about nested components and how properties cascade or compose.",
  "should i include confidence scores in the component analysis": "Yes, include confidence scores (0-1) for classifications and detections. Higher confidence (>0.8) for clear component types with standard naming and structure. Medium confidence (0.5-0.8) for components that could fit multiple categories. Lower confidence (<0.5) when manual review is needed. This helps users identify which classifications may need human verification.",
  "how do i handle complex nested component structures": "Analyze component hierarchies recursively, documenting parent-child relationships and composition patterns. Identify which nested components are part of the component's API versus internal implementation details. Track how properties flow through the component tree and document any property forwarding or transformation patterns.",
  "what tests should verify component understanding accuracy": "Write tests that verify correct classification of known component types, accurate detection of all variants, proper extraction of properties with correct types and defaults, and validation of component hierarchy relationships. Include edge cases like components with no variants, deeply nested structures, and components using instance swaps.",
  "how should i document the component analysis for code generation": "Generate structured JSON output with component metadata including type, variants, properties, composition structure, and usage guidelines. Include examples of valid property combinations and references to similar components in common UI libraries. Add visual metadata like dominant colors, sizes, and spacing to aid in code generation decisions."
