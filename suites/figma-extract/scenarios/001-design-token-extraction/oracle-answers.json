{
  "what design token types should i extract from figma": "Extract all four primary token types: colors (including hex values and opacity), typography (font families, sizes, weights, line heights), spacing (padding, margin, gap values), and effects (shadows, blur effects, borders). Each token type should be extracted with its complete metadata including names and values.",
  "what format should the generated token files use": "Generate tokens as structured JSON files with proper naming conventions. Use semantic naming (e.g., 'color-primary-500' instead of 'blue-1') and organize tokens hierarchically by category. Include both the raw values and any computed variations needed for different contexts.",
  "should i validate the extracted tokens for consistency": "Yes, validate tokens for naming consistency, value format correctness, and ensure no duplicates exist. Check that color values are valid hex/rgb/hsl, typography values use valid CSS units, and spacing follows a consistent scale (e.g., 4px, 8px, 16px).",
  "how should i handle missing or incomplete design tokens in figma": "Log warnings for missing tokens but continue extraction. For incomplete tokens, use sensible defaults where possible and document what was filled in. Generate a report listing any tokens that couldn't be fully extracted so designers can review and complete them in Figma.",
  "what documentation should accompany the token files": "Include a README explaining the token structure, naming conventions, and usage examples. Document each token category with its purpose and valid values. Add migration notes if replacing existing tokens, and include code examples showing how to import and use tokens in components.",
  "should tests verify all token types are extracted correctly": "Yes, write tests that verify extraction of colors, typography, spacing, and effects. Tests should check JSON structure validity, token naming patterns, value format correctness, and that all expected tokens from the Figma file are present in the output.",
  "what approach should i use for organizing tokens by theme or variant": "Organize tokens with a base layer for common values and theme layers for variations. Use a consistent structure where themes can override base tokens. For example, have a 'base.json' with all tokens and 'theme-dark.json' that overrides color tokens for dark mode while inheriting typography and spacing."
