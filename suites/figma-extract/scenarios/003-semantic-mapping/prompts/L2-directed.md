Build a semantic mapping system that translates Figma components to ShadCN UI components with accurate property and variant mapping. Convert Figma variant names to library-specific variants like Primary to variant="default". Translate component properties to appropriate props and generate import statements. Structure output as JSON with component mappings including library, component name, import path, and props.
