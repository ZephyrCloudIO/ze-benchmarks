  "which component libraries should i map figma components to": "Map to modern React component libraries: ShadCN/ui (preferred for new projects), Radix UI primitives, and Material-UI (MUI) as alternatives. Choose the library that best matches the design system's patterns and complexity. ShadCN is ideal for customizable designs, Radix for headless components, and MUI for Material Design adherence.",
  "how do i determine the correct library component for each figma component": "Match Figma components to library components based on semantic purpose, not just visual appearance. A Figma 'CTA Button' maps to Button component, 'Text Field' to Input or TextField. Analyze the component's interactive elements, states, and variants to find the closest library match. Consider functionality over aesthetics - a custom-styled button is still semantically a Button.",
  "how should i translate figma properties to component props": "Map Figma properties to library-specific props with correct typing. For example, Figma 'size' variant (sm/md/lg) maps to ShadCN Button size prop, 'style' variant (primary/secondary) maps to variant prop. Handle type conversions: boolean properties map to boolean props, text properties to string props. Document any property transformations needed (e.g., color names to theme values).",
  "what should i do when figma variants don't match library variants exactly": "Create a mapping layer that translates Figma variant names to library prop values. If Figma has 'emphasize: high/medium/low' but the library uses 'variant: solid/outline/ghost', define the mapping rules. When no direct match exists, use the closest semantic equivalent and document the translation. Consider creating wrapper components for complex mappings.",
  "how do i handle composition patterns in component mapping": "Map Figma component composition to library composition patterns. For example, if a Figma Card component contains Header, Body, and Footer layers, map to library's compound component pattern (Card, CardHeader, CardContent, CardFooter). Preserve the component hierarchy and document any differences in how composition is structured between Figma and the library.",
  "what tests should verify mapping accuracy": "Write tests that verify correct library component selection for each Figma component type, accurate prop translations with correct types and values, variant mappings produce expected component configurations, and composition patterns maintain the correct hierarchy. Include edge cases like components with complex nested variants and unconventional property combinations.",
  "how should i document the mapping decisions": "Create a mapping manifest that documents each Figma component's corresponding library component, prop mappings with type conversions, variant translation rules, and any special handling required. Include reasoning for mapping choices, especially for ambiguous cases. Provide code examples showing how the mapped components should be used with real prop values from Figma designs."
