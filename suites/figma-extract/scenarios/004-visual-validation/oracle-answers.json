  "what approach should i use to compare rendered code with figma designs": "Use a multi-layered validation approach: (1) Pixel-level comparison using screenshot diffing for exact visual matching, (2) Semantic analysis checking layout properties, colors, typography, and spacing match within acceptable thresholds, (3) Structural validation ensuring DOM hierarchy matches Figma layer structure. Start with semantic analysis to catch major issues, then use pixel comparison for fine-tuning.",
  "how should i capture screenshots of rendered components for comparison": "Render components in a headless browser environment at multiple viewport sizes to match Figma frame dimensions. Capture screenshots in consistent conditions: same browser, color profile, and zoom level. Take screenshots of each component variant and state (hover, focus, disabled). Save screenshots with descriptive names linking them to their corresponding Figma components.",
  "what tolerance thresholds should i use for visual differences": "Use different thresholds for different validation types: Pixel comparison should allow 1-2% difference for anti-aliasing variations. Color values should match within 5 RGB units to account for rendering differences. Spacing and dimensions should match within 1-2px for rounding. Typography can have slight sub-pixel rendering differences. Set stricter thresholds for critical UI elements like buttons and forms.",
  "how do i distinguish meaningful differences from rendering artifacts": "Ignore sub-pixel anti-aliasing differences, font rendering variations across platforms, and minor browser-specific rendering quirks. Focus on meaningful differences: wrong colors, incorrect spacing/sizing, missing elements, incorrect layout structure, and wrong typography properties. Use perceptual diff algorithms that ignore noise and highlight structural or color differences.",
  "what information should visual validation reports include": "Generate reports showing side-by-side comparisons of Figma designs and rendered code, difference percentages and pixel diff highlights, lists of semantic mismatches (wrong colors, spacing, etc.), screenshots of all tested variants and states, and actionable recommendations for fixing issues. Include an overall similarity score and breakdown by validation category.",
  "how should i calculate visual similarity scores": "Calculate composite scores combining pixel similarity (30%), semantic accuracy (40%), and structural correctness (30%). Pixel similarity uses image diff algorithms. Semantic accuracy checks color accuracy, spacing correctness, and typography matching. Structural correctness validates layout hierarchy and element positioning. Aggregate scores with weighted averaging to produce an overall match percentage.",
  "what tests should verify the validation system works correctly": "Write tests using known-good and known-bad reference cases. Test that identical renders score 100%, renders with known differences are detected and scored appropriately, different types of differences (color, spacing, missing elements) are all caught, and the system handles edge cases like responsive layouts, animations, and conditional rendering."
