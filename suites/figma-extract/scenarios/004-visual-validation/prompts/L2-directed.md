Build a visual validation system that compares generated components against Figma designs using multiple methods: pixel comparison, structural comparison, and style comparison. Use Playwright to capture component screenshots in isolated environments. Generate detailed diff reports with highlighted differences and similarity scores. Set validation thresholds (90% similarity minimum) and categorize issues by severity.
