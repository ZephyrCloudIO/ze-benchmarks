  "what formats should i generate for color tokens": "Generate multiple formats for maximum compatibility: (1) CSS custom properties for direct browser use, (2) JSON/JavaScript objects for programmatic access, (3) Sass/LESS variables for preprocessor workflows, (4) Tailwind configuration for utility-first frameworks. Each format should include all color tokens with consistent naming across formats.",
  "how should i structure css custom properties for the color system": "Define CSS custom properties using semantic naming in :root scope. Use a hierarchical structure like --color-primary-500, --color-primary-hover, --color-text-primary. Create separate property sets for different themes (light/dark) that can be scoped to data attributes or classes. Include fallback values for browser compatibility.",
  "what approach should i use for supporting multiple themes": "Use a token layering system: base tokens define the actual color values, semantic tokens map to base tokens (primary, secondary, error), and theme tokens override semantic mappings for different themes. Store theme variations as separate CSS scopes that can be applied via data-theme attributes. Ensure theme switching doesn't cause flashing by preloading theme styles.",
  "should i validate color accessibility when generating the color system": "Yes, validate WCAG contrast ratios for all text and background color combinations. Flag combinations that don't meet AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text). Generate warnings for insufficient contrast and suggest alternative color pairings. Include contrast ratios in the generated documentation so developers can make informed decisions.",
  "how do i handle color transformations like opacity and blending": "Extract base colors as solid values and generate opacity variants using CSS custom properties with RGB or HSL formats that support alpha channels. For example, define --color-primary-rgb: 59, 130, 246 and use rgba(var(--color-primary-rgb), 0.5) for 50% opacity. Document common opacity levels (10%, 20%, 50%, etc.) as pre-generated variants.",
  "what utilities should i generate alongside the color tokens": "Generate utility classes for common use cases: background colors (.bg-primary), text colors (.text-primary), border colors (.border-primary), and hover variants (.hover:bg-primary-dark). If using Tailwind, generate plugin configuration that adds these utilities. Include opacity utilities and color-based gradients.",
  "what documentation should accompany the color system": "Document the complete color palette with visual swatches, color names and values in all formats, semantic meaning and usage guidelines for each color, accessibility information including contrast ratios, theme switching implementation guide, and code examples for each usage pattern (CSS variables, utility classes, programmatic access). Include migration guidance if replacing an existing color system."
