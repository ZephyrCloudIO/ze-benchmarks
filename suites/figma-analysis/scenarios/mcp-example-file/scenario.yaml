title: "Analyze MCP Example Figma File"
description: |
  Analyze the MCP Example Figma design file and extract comprehensive design specifications.
  
  The agent should:
  - Fetch the Figma file using the fetchFigmaFile tool
  - Extract all design tokens (colors, typography, spacing, shadows)
  - Identify and document component structures
  - Analyze layout patterns and responsive behavior
  - Provide accessibility audit
  - Generate structured component specifications
  
  Success criteria:
  - All design tokens extracted and organized
  - Component hierarchy clearly documented
  - Layout patterns identified
  - Accessibility considerations noted
  - Implementation guidance provided
