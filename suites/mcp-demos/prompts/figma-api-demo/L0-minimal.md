# MCP Figma API Operations Demo

Demonstrate the Figma MCP integration with authentication by:
1. Verifying authentication using the figma_get_me MCP tool to confirm the FIGMA_API_KEY works
2. Retrieving a Figma file using the figma_get_file MCP tool (you can use a public Figma community file)
3. Summarizing what you found and confirming authentication worked

If authentication fails, explain how to set up FIGMA_API_KEY in the .env file.

Make sure to clearly state which MCP tools you're using and verify the operations succeeded.
