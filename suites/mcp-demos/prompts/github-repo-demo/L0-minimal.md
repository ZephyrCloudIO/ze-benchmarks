# MCP GitHub Operations Demo

Demonstrate the GitHub MCP integration by:
1. Searching for repositories related to "MCP" or "model context protocol" using the search_repositories MCP tool
2. Retrieving the README file from one of the found repositories using the get_file_contents MCP tool
3. Summarizing what you found

Make sure to clearly state which MCP tools you're using and verify the operations succeeded.
