Instead of installing pre-packaged components from NPM, shadcn/ui provides direct access to component source code that developers can copy into their projects and fully customize. This 'Open Code' approach gives developers complete transparency and control over their components, making it easy to modify behavior, styling, and functionality without wrestling with library overrides or wrappers. The platform is built on five core principles: Open Code (full access to modify component source), Composition (consistent, predictable API across all components), Distribution (flat-file schema and CLI for component management), Beautiful Defaults (carefully designed styles that work together), and AI-Ready (code structure optimized for LLM understanding and generation).\n\n**Key Concepts**: {\"title\":\"Official shadcn/ui documentation\",\"summary\":\"shadcn/ui is a component distribution platform and design system that fundamentally differs from traditional component libraries.

It covers the initial project creation process using the shadcn CLI tool, which can be used to either create a new Next.js project or configure an existing one. The guide emphasizes the use of package managers (pnpm, npm, yarn, or bun) to execute the initialization command that sets up the necessary configuration for shadcn/ui components.\n\nThe documentation demonstrates the component installation workflow, showing how to add individual UI components like the Button component to a project using the CLI's add command. It includes practical code examples showing how to import and use installed components within Next.js pages, specifically demonstrating the Button component usage in an app/page.tsx file. The guide also references deployment options via Vercel and mentions the availability of source code on GitHub.\n\nThe documentation is part of a larger shadcn/ui ecosystem that includes various components, theming options, dark mode support, and integration with modern React and Next.js features. It serves as an entry point for developers looking to quickly bootstrap a Next.js project with a comprehensive UI component library built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.\n\n**Key Concepts**: {\"title\":\"Next.js installation guide\",\"summary\":\"This documentation provides a comprehensive installation and setup guide for integrating shadcn/ui with Next.js projects.

It provides extensive CSS variable definitions for colors (background, foreground, primary, secondary, muted, accent, destructive, border, input, ring), chart colors, sidebar theming, and border radius values. The theming uses the OKLCH color space and Tailwind CSS v4's @theme inline directive to map CSS variables to Tailwind utilities. A custom dark mode variant is configured using @custom-variant.\n\nThe setup concludes with creating a cn utility helper function for merging Tailwind classes and a components.json configuration file that defines project structure, style preferences, and path aliases. This configuration file serves as the foundation for the shadcn/ui component system, specifying the New York style variant, TypeScript usage, CSS variables approach, and icon library choice (Lucide).\n\n**Key Concepts**: {\"title\":\"Installation and configuration information for manual install\",\"summary\":\"This documentation provides comprehensive instructions for manually installing and configuring shadcn/ui components in a project without using the CLI.

Instead of installing pre-packaged components from NPM, shadcn/ui provides direct access to component source code that developers can copy into their projects and fully customize. This 'Open Code' approach gives developers complete transparency and control over their components, making it easy to modify behavior, styling, and functionality without wrestling with library overrides or wrappers. The platform is built on five core principles: Open Code (full access to modify component source), Composition (consistent, predictable API across all components), Distribution (flat-file schema and CLI for component management), Beautiful Defaults (carefully designed styles that work together), and AI-Ready (code structure optimized for LLM understanding and generation).\n\n**Key Concepts**: {\"title\":\"Official shadcn/ui documentation\",\"summary\":\"shadcn/ui is a component distribution platform and design system that fundamentally differs from traditional component libraries.

The platform is built on five core principles: Open Code (full access to modify component source), Composition (consistent, predictable API across all components), Distribution (flat-file schema and CLI for component management), Beautiful Defaults (carefully designed styles that work together), and AI-Ready (code structure optimized for LLM understanding and generation).\",\"key_concepts\":[\"Open Code - direct access to component source code for full customization\",\"Composition - shared, predictable interface across all components\",\"Distribution - flat-file schema and CLI for component distribution\",\"Beautiful Defaults - pre-designed consistent styling system\",\"AI-Ready - code structure optimized for LLM integration\",\"Not a traditional component library - code ownership model\",\"Cross-framework support via CLI\",\"Component customization without library overrides\",\"Unified design system with consistent API\"],\"link\":\"https://ui.shadcn.com/docs\",\"code_patterns\":[\"Components are copied directly into project rather than installed as dependencies\",\"All components share a common composable interface for predictability\",\"CLI tool used to distribute and install components: schema-based distribution\",\"Components built on Radix UI primitives with Tailwind CSS styling\",\"Flat-file structure defines components, dependencies, and properties\"],\"relevance_score\":70}\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Next.js installation guide\n\nThis documentation provides a comprehensive installation and setup guide for integrating shadcn/ui with Next.js projects. It covers the initial project creation process using the shadcn CLI tool, which can be used to either create a new Next.js project or configure an existing one. The guide emphasizes the use of package managers (pnpm, npm, yarn, or bun) to execute the initialization command that sets up the necessary configuration for shadcn/ui components.\n\nThe documentation demonstrates the component installation workflow, showing how to add individual UI components like the Button component to a project using the CLI's add command. It includes practical code examples showing how to import and use installed components within Next.js pages, specifically demonstrating the Button component usage in an app/page.tsx file. The guide also references deployment options via Vercel and mentions the availability of source code on GitHub.\n\nThe documentation is part of a larger shadcn/ui ecosystem that includes various components, theming options, dark mode support, and integration with modern React and Next.js features. It serves as an entry point for developers looking to quickly bootstrap a Next.js project with a comprehensive UI component library built on top of Radix UI and Tailwind CSS.\n\n**Key Concepts**: {\"title\":\"Next.js installation guide\",\"summary\":\"This documentation provides a comprehensive installation and setup guide for integrating shadcn/ui with Next.js projects.

The guide emphasizes manual configuration for developers who prefer more control over their setup or need to integrate shadcn/ui into existing projects.\n\nThe documentation details the theming system using CSS variables with support for both light and dark modes. It provides extensive CSS variable definitions for colors (background, foreground, primary, secondary, muted, accent, destructive, border, input, ring), chart colors, sidebar theming, and border radius values. The theming uses the OKLCH color space and Tailwind CSS v4's @theme inline directive to map CSS variables to Tailwind utilities. A custom dark mode variant is configured using @custom-variant.\n\nThe setup concludes with creating a cn utility helper function for merging Tailwind classes and a components.json configuration file that defines project structure, style preferences, and path aliases. This configuration file serves as the foundation for the shadcn/ui component system, specifying the New York style variant, TypeScript usage, CSS variables approach, and icon library choice (Lucide).\n\n**Key Concepts**: {\"title\":\"Installation and configuration information for manual install\",\"summary\":\"This documentation provides comprehensive instructions for manually installing and configuring shadcn/ui components in a project without using the CLI.

Instead of installing pre-packaged components from NPM, shadcn/ui provides direct access to component source code that developers can copy into their projects and fully customize. This 'Open Code' approach gives developers complete transparency and control over their components, making it easy to modify behavior, styling, and functionality without wrestling with library overrides or wrappers. The platform is built on five core principles: Open Code (full access to modify component source), Composition (consistent, predictable API across all components), Distribution (flat-file schema and CLI for component management), Beautiful Defaults (carefully designed styles that work together), and AI-Ready (code structure optimized for LLM understanding and generation).\n\n**Key Concepts**: {\"title\":\"Official shadcn/ui documentation\",\"summary\":\"shadcn/ui is a component distribution platform and design system that fundamentally differs from traditional component libraries.

It covers the initial project creation process using the shadcn CLI tool, which can be used to either create a new Next.js project or configure an existing one. The guide emphasizes the use of package managers (pnpm, npm, yarn, or bun) to execute the initialization command that sets up the necessary configuration for shadcn/ui components.\n\nThe documentation demonstrates the component installation workflow, showing how to add individual UI components like the Button component to a project using the CLI's add command. It includes practical code examples showing how to import and use installed components within Next.js pages, specifically demonstrating the Button component usage in an app/page.tsx file. The guide also references deployment options via Vercel and mentions the availability of source code on GitHub.\n\nThe documentation is part of a larger shadcn/ui ecosystem that includes various components, theming options, dark mode support, and integration with modern React and Next.js features.
