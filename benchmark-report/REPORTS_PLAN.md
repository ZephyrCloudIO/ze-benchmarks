   - Total Score (average across all evaluators)
   - Weighted Score (out of 10, with custom weights)
   - Individual evaluator scores (install_success, tests_nonregression, manager_correctness, dependency_targets, integrity_guard)
   - LLM Judge scores with 7 categories (dependency_quality, safety_stability, best_practices, etc.)

2. **Telemetry Data**
   - Tool calls count
   - Tokens: input and output
   - Cost (USD)
   - Duration (milliseconds)

3. **Metadata**
   - Suite, Scenario, Tier (L0-L3, Lx)

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Access Layer
- Use existing BenchmarkLogger methods:
  - `getRunHistory()` - recent runs
  - `getStats()` - overall statistics with filters
  - `getSuiteStats()` - suite-level data
  - `getScenarioStats()` - scenario-level data
  - `getDetailedRunStats()` - single run details
  - `getModelPerformanceStats()` - model comparison
  - `getBatchHistory()` / `getBatchDetails()` - batch data

### Additional Queries Needed
Some proposed reports may need new database queries:
- Time-series aggregations (daily/weekly/monthly rollups)
- Cost aggregations by various dimensions
- Token usage aggregations
- Correlation calculations
- Percentile calculations for scores/costs
