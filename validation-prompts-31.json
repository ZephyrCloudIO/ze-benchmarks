It walks developers through creating a new project, adding Tailwind CSS, configuring TypeScript paths, setting up Vite, and installing shadcn/ui components.\n\n**Key Concepts**: Vite project initialization with React and TypeScript, Tailwind CSS integration, TypeScript path configuration, Vite configuration for path resolution, shadcn/ui component installation, Path aliases setup\n\n**Code Patterns from Documentation**:\n- `npm create vite@latest`\n- `tsconfig.json path configuration`\n- `vite.config.ts path resolution`\n- `npx shadcn@latest init`\n- `npx shadcn@latest add button`\n\n---\n\n### Docs\n\n**📄 Documentation URL**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs.md\n**YOU MUST READ THIS PAGE FIRST**\n\n**Summary**: shadcn/ui is an innovative approach to component library development that prioritizes open-source, customizable, and AI-friendly design. Unlike traditional component libraries, it provides developers with direct access to component source code, enabling full transparency and easy customization. The library is built on principles of open code, composability, and beautiful default styles, allowing developers to modify components to fit their specific design requirements.\n\n**Key Concepts**: Open Code Architecture, Composable Component Interface, Code Distribution System, AI-Ready Component Design, Headless Component Architecture, Unified Design System\n\n**Code Patterns from Documentation**:\n- `Direct component code modification`\n- `Composable component interface`\n- `Headless component architecture with open customization layer`\n\n---\n\n### Components Json\n\n**📄 Documentation URL**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components-json.md\n**YOU MUST READ THIS PAGE FIRST**\n\n**Summary**: The `components.json` file is a configuration file used in shadcn/ui projects to define project setup, component generation, and registry settings. It provides a centralized way to configure project-specific details like styling, Tailwind CSS settings, component generation preferences, and resource registries.\n\n**Key Concepts**: Project configuration management, Component generation settings, Tailwind CSS customization, Path alias configuration, Registry and resource management, React Server Component support, TypeScript/JavaScript component generation\n\n**Code Patterns from Documentation**:\n- `npx shadcn@latest init`\n- `components.json base configuration`\n- `Tailwind CSS configuration`\n- `Registry configuration with authentication`\n- `Path alias configuration`\n\n---\n\n"

I follow the official documentation exactly, understand that shadcn is a code distribution platform (not a library), and ensure proper configuration of Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript path aliases, and component installation. Before saying you are successful make sure you run a package manager install, build, and test. If no packageManager is specified I default to npm and the commands are npm install, npm run build, and npm run test.\n\nSet up a new vite project with shadcn/ui, using npm and configuring button component, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript\n\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Required Documentation Reading\n\n**YOU MUST START BY USING THE WEB FETCH TOOL TO READ THESE DOCUMENTATION PAGES BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH ANY IMPLEMENTATION.**\n\nThese documentation pages contain essential patterns and configurations that you must follow exactly.\n\n### Vite\n\n**📄 Documentation URL**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite.md\n**YOU MUST READ THIS PAGE FIRST**\n\n**Summary**: This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for setting up a Vite project with React and TypeScript, focusing on integrating shadcn/ui and configuring the development environment. It walks developers through creating a new project, adding Tailwind CSS, configuring TypeScript paths, setting up Vite, and installing shadcn/ui components.\n\n**Key Concepts**: Vite project initialization with React and TypeScript, Tailwind CSS integration, TypeScript path configuration, Vite configuration for path resolution, shadcn/ui component installation, Path aliases setup\n\n**Code Patterns from Documentation**:\n- `npm create vite@latest`\n- `tsconfig.json path configuration`\n- `vite.config.ts path resolution`\n- `npx shadcn@latest init`\n- `npx shadcn@latest add button`\n\n---\n\n### Docs\n\n**📄 Documentation URL**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs.md\n**YOU MUST READ THIS PAGE FIRST**\n\n**Summary**: shadcn/ui is an innovative approach to component library development that prioritizes open-source, customizable, and AI-friendly design. Unlike traditional component libraries, it provides developers with direct access to component source code, enabling full transparency and easy customization. The library is built on principles of open code, composability, and beautiful default styles, allowing developers to modify components to fit their specific design requirements.\n\n**Key Concepts**: Open Code Architecture, Composable Component Interface, Code Distribution System, AI-Ready Component Design, Headless Component Architecture, Unified Design System\n\n**Code Patterns from Documentation**:\n- `Direct component code modification`\n- `Composable component interface`\n- `Headless component architecture with open customization layer`\n\n---\n\n### Components Json\n\n**📄 Documentation URL**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components-json.md\n**YOU MUST READ THIS PAGE FIRST**\n\n**Summary**: The `components.json` file is a configuration file used in shadcn/ui projects to define project setup, component generation, and registry settings. It provides a centralized way to configure project-specific details like styling, Tailwind CSS settings, component generation preferences, and resource registries.\n\n**Key Concepts**: Project configuration management, Component generation settings, Tailwind CSS customization, Path alias configuration, Registry and resource management, React Server Component support, TypeScript/JavaScript component generation\n\n**Code Patterns from Documentation**:\n- `npx shadcn@latest init`\n- `components.json base configuration`\n- `Tailwind CSS configuration`\n- `Registry configuration with authentication`\n- `Path alias configuration`\n\n---\n\n"
