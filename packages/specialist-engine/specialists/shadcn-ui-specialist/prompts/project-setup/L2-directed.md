Set up new project

Steps:
1. A component distribution method where actual component code is provided, allowing full customization and transparency
2. Shared, predictable interface for components across different frameworks
3. A code distribution platform with flat-file schema and CLI for component management

Constraints:
- Difficulty customizing pre-built components or extending functionality

Verify all configurations are correct and test the build.
