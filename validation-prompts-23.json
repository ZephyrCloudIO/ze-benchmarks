I follow the official documentation exactly, understand that shadcn is a code distribution platform (not a library), and ensure proper configuration of Tailwind CSS v4, TypeScript path aliases, and component installation. Before saying you are successful make sure you run a package manager install, lint, and test. If no packageManager is specified I default to npm.\n\nSet up a new vite project with shadcn/ui, using pnpm and configuring button component, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript\n\n\n## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Required Documentation Reading\n\n**YOU MUST START BY USING THE WEB FETCH TOOL TO READ THESE DOCUMENTATION PAGES BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH ANY IMPLEMENTATION.**\n\nThese documentation pages contain essential patterns and configurations that you must follow exactly.\n\n### Vite\n\n**📄 Documentation URL**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite\n**YOU MUST READ THIS PAGE FIRST**\n\n**Summary**: This documentation provides a comprehensive guide for setting up a Vite project with shadcn/ui, focusing on creating a React application with TypeScript and integrating various development tools. The guide walks through project initialization, configuring Tailwind CSS, setting up path aliases, and installing shadcn/ui components using the CLI.\n\n**Key Concepts**: Vite project setup with React and TypeScript, Tailwind CSS integration, TypeScript configuration with path aliases, shadcn/ui component installation, CLI-driven component management\n\n**Code Patterns from Documentation**:\n- `pnpm create vite@latest`\n- `import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'`\n- `vite.config.ts path resolution`\n- `tsconfig.json path configuration`\n- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init`\n\n---\n\n### Docs\n\n**📄 Documentation URL**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs\n**YOU MUST READ THIS PAGE FIRST**\n\n**Summary**: shadcn/ui is an innovative open-source component library that fundamentally differs from traditional component libraries by providing direct access to component source code. Instead of installing a pre-built package, users get the actual component code they can fully customize and extend, giving developers complete transparency and flexibility in their UI development.\n\n**Key Concepts**: Open Code Approach, Composable Component Interface, Code Distribution System, AI-Ready Component Design, Customizable Default Styles, Cross-Framework Support\n\n**Code Patterns from Documentation**:\n- `Direct component code modification`\n- `Composable component interface`\n- `CLI-based component distribution`\n- `Customizable default styles`\n\n---\n\n### Cli\n\n**📄 Documentation URL**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli\n**YOU MUST READ THIS PAGE FIRST**\n\n**Summary**: The documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the shadcn CLI, a powerful tool for managing UI components in modern web development projects. It details various commands for initializing projects, adding components, viewing and searching registries, and building component configurations. The CLI is designed to streamline the process of setting up and customizing UI components across different project types and tech stacks.\n\n**Key Concepts**: CLI-driven component management, Registry-based component installation, Flexible project initialization, CSS variables theming, Multi-package manager support, Component search and view capabilities\n\n**Code Patterns from Documentation**:\n- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest init`\n- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add [component]`\n- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest view [item]`\n- `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest search [registry]`\n\n---\n\n"
